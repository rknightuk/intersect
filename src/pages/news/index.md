There is a fairly common idea that it is your civic duty to follow the news and keep up with current events. I strongly disagree with this.

There is something to be said for keeping up with what the government is doing on a regular basis so you can ~~moan about it on Twitter~~ write to your local MP to object to something. I believe it is important to hold your representatives to account even if it feels fruitless.

News stories are fleeting. Go back and read and the news from a week or a month ago and see just how many stories are actually important.
