I stream music with Apple Music having given up mostly on my local library a few years ago. I still import a number of albums that Apple Music doesn't have (mostly weird off-the-back-of-a-truck B-sides and acoustic albums).

I used to use [Last.fm](https://last.fm) but that stopped working at some point and I just never set it back up again.

Always save a copy of playlists made by someone else, otherwise they might change (looking at your Spotify) or get deleted. I once had to email [MC Lars](https://mclars.com) because his "guestlist" playlist on Spotify got deleted and I couldn't remember the name of a song I liked from it.

## Favourite Artists

In no particular order:

- [Bowling for Soup](https://www.bowlingforsoup.com/)
- [Linkin Park](http://www.linkinpark.com/)
- [Foo Fighters](https://foofighters.com)
- [Lonely Island](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Lonely_Island)
- [The Dollyrots](http://thedollyrots.com)
- [Punk Rock Factory](http://punkrockfactory.com)
- [McFly](http://mcfly.com)

## Playlists

I generally like to listen to all songs by an artist on random but doing so on Apple Music quickly is a bit of a pain so I create playlists for different artists with all thier albums and songs that I can put shuffle.

I also maintain playlists for all the [Tony Hawk Pro Skater](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tony_Hawk%27s_Pro_Skater_(video_game)) games.

### Playlist of Loved Songs

You can do this with a smart playlist (Rule: "Loved is Loved") but songs will only show up in here if they've also been added to you library.

## "Cloud playlists can only contain songs from your Cloud music library" Fix

Sometimes Music won't upload a song when you import it. Right click on it and choose "Add to library".
