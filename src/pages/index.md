I'm [Robb Knight](https://rknight.me) and this is ~~my digital garden~~ the Intersect. Everything I know. Mostly.

## What Is This?

To quote Nikita Volodoev directly from [their wiki](https://wiki.nikiv.dev/).

> This is my personal wiki where I share everything I know about this world in form of an online GitBook hosted on GitHub.

I stumbled across Nikita's wiki while looking for [Alfred Workflows](/macos/alfred/) and thought it was a great idea. I'd been toying with the idea of making a Tumblr-like blog for little snippets and ideas that don't deserve a full blog post but it always seemed overkill. To update that quote to better reflect my setup:

> This is my personal wiki where I share everything I know about this world in form of **website hosted on [Digital Ocean](https://www.digitalocean.com/?refcode=8e1d8283bd20) and [uploaded to Github](https://github.com/rknightuk/intersect)**.

I found out these are sometimes called [Digital Gardens](/meta). There's a [subreddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/DigitalGardens/) (of course there is) and this is a rabbit-hole I'm not sure I really have time to go down but here we are.

Each page is a file and each file follows a similar structure:

- The title of the page
- Introduction/quick thought about the topic
- Subheading for each section with details
- Interesting links related to the topic

A lot of the pages will just be snippets and links that I want to remember. For example, the [Javascript page](/programming/js) is just a few snippets of things I always need to look up, plus some interesting links.

## How?

[Gitbook](https://www.gitbook.com) is the obvious choice for something like this and there are bunch of other options as well. I wanted full control of how it looked, the layout of pages, and more so I rolled my own. To [quote myself](https://twitter.com/rknightuk/status/1426307649365286921):

> Internet: There are many existing solutions for this
> Me, a developer and also an idiot: but what if built my own solution instead

[The meta pages](/meta) have more details on the setup.

## Why "Intersect"?

The name is a reference to [the government database of intelligence](https://chuck-nbc.fandom.com/wiki/The_Intersect) that the titular character gets embedded in his in head in the TV show [Chuck](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chuck_(TV_series)).
