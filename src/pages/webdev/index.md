title: Web Development
---

I put all of my side projects [on GitHub](https://github.com/rknightuk). If someone wants to copy them, adapt them, learn from them, that's great. Don't worry if the code is terrible as long as it works (unless you're working with other people then maybe try a bit harder).

## Domains

I buy all of my domains through [Hover](https://hover.com/scHIv4WR). I've never had an issue with them and they don't try to upsell you on things you don't need.

## Stack

Generally I use one of two stacks:

- [Laravel](https://laravel.com) with [React](https://reactjs.org) front-end for larger projects like [Almanac](/projects/almanac)
- A [static site generator](/webdev/static-site-generators) for smaller projects like blogs or the [Monzo Pot Image Generator](/projects/monzo-pot-image-generator/)

Either of these will usually be deployed with [Laravel Forge](https://forge.laravel.com) onto a [Digital Ocean](https://www.digitalocean.com/?refcode=8e1d8283bd20) server.
