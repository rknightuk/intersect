I have recorded and edited over 130 episodes of [my podcast](https://www.ruminatepodcast.com/) so I know _some_ things but this is a basically a list of things I use.

If you want to hear from actual professionals I recommend [episode 200 of Upgrade](https://www.relay.fm/upgrade/200).

I record using a ~~[Blue Yeti](https://www.bluemic.com/en-gb/products/yeti/)~~ [Razer Seiren Mini](https://www.razer.com/streaming-microphones/razer-seiren-mini/RZ19-03450100-R3M1). There are much better microphones available

- Call with Skype or Zoom
- Record my local audio plus Skype backup with [Audio Hijack Pro](https://rogueamoeba.com/audiohijackpro/)
- Edit in [GarageBand](https://www.apple.com/uk/mac/garageband/). It would probably be easier in [Logic Pro](https://www.apple.com/uk/logic-pro/) but I'm not paying for it
- Edit metadata and chapters with [Forecast](https://overcast.fm/forecast)
- Hosted ~~with [Simplecast](https://simplecast.com/)~~ my own custom site
